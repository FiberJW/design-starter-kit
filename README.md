## Getting Started

1. Make sure that you have [`expo-cli`](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/) installed.

1. F\*\*k this repo with the button near the top right of this GitHub page. Oh, and while you're up there, you might as well click the star button too ðŸ˜‰.

1. Clone your fork, `cd` into it, and `yarn` to install your Expo and React Router dependencies.

1. Run `expo start --web --dev` in your project folder and get designing!

## Deploying

Follow [Expo's guides for distribution](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v35.0.0/distribution/introduction/) to get your prototype on other people's devices.

## Navigation

Use the modules exported from `'./navigation.ts'` to ensure that your routes will work across web and native. Also, opt to use the `useHistory` hook over the `Link` API as the `Link` component works differently across web and native.

## Typography

The typeface selected for this starter kit is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/).

## Colors

I think HSL is dope, so I keep my colors in `hsla()` form in `'./styles/colors.ts'`.
